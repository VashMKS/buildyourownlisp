# Learning C by Building a Lisp-like Interpreter

As the title says, the purpose of this repository is not to actually craft a useful Lisp variant, but to learn the basics of the C language, as well as some fundamentals on compiler design and the Lisp family of languages.

The code follows the book *Build Your Own Lisp* by Daniel Holden, which is available online for free at [buildyourownlisp.com](buildyourownlisp.com). For more information, check out the first couple of chapters online.
